Merged PR diff (context):
<diff>
{diff}
</diff>

Docspec (requirements for the markdown file):
<docspec path="{docspec_path}">
{docspec}
</docspec>

Current markdown content:
<markdown path="{md_path}">
{md_text}
</markdown>

Task:
1. Explore the repository using your available tools to understand the codebase context
2. Understand how the code changes in the diff relate to the documentation
3. Update the markdown file at {md_path} to satisfy the docspec given the code changes
4. Always output an empty string (files are modified directly)
